This web application is written using ***Django Framework***.

### What is this for?


The project is being developed to consolidate and improve my skills. In addition, I need a website for selling goods that I produce using a 3D printer.

### What should the result be?

This should be a site with user authorization, online orders and the ability to buy an existing product from the listed ones.

### Current result:

Two pages available: 
  1. Main page
  2. Authorization page

### Further plans:


- [ ] Create page with products
- [ ] Сonnect the product database
- [ ] Display the product database on the product page as a table
- [ ] Сonnect user database
- [ ] Set up user registration
- [ ] Create profile page
- [ ] Set up user login to the site
