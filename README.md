This web application is created using ***Django Framework***.

### What is this for?


The project is being developed to consolidate and improve my skills. In addition, I need a website for selling goods that I produce using a 3D printer.

### What should the result be?

This should be a site with user authorization, online orders and the ability to buy an existing product from the list.

### Current result:

  1. Main page
  2. Authorization page


  _05.11 Update:_
    
  4. Product page
  5. Product database is connected
  6. Products are displayed on the products page

### Further plans:


- [x] Create page with products

- [x] Display the product database on the product page as a table
- [ ] Сonnect user database
- [ ] Set up user registration
- [ ] Create profile page
